# Roc Examples

We want the examples website to be the centralized place to find your up-to-date, roc-expert-approved answer to common search queries like "How to X in roc".

Website coming soon, until then check the [examples folder](https://github.com/roc-lang/examples/tree/main/examples)!

## Running an example

1. [Install Roc](https://github.com/roc-lang/roc/tree/main/getting_started#installation)
2. For the json example: `roc run examples/Json/main.roc`
