This shows a few basic ways to use a `Task` in the [basic-cli platform](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli). You can read more about tasks in the [tutorial](https://www.roc-lang.org/tutorial#tasks).

## Code

file:main.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```
$ roc run
Bonjour, Sam!

Oops, another failure!
