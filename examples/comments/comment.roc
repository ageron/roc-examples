# Roc does not support native multi-line comments.
# However, many text editors provide shortcuts to comment multiple lines at once.

# Example of commenting multiple lines using a text editor shortcut:
# - In VSCode, you can use Ctrl+/ to comment or uncomment multiple lines.
# - Other editors may have similar shortcuts.

# Keep in mind that this is a workaround, and it may vary depending on the text editor you are using.
# Be sure to check your editor's documentation for the specific shortcut to comment or uncomment multiple lines.
