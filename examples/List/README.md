# List Pattern Matching

A Roc solution to one of the 99 Lisp problems - Find the number of elements in a list & Find an element in a list. Here we can use pattern matching on a list to count the number of elements recursively.

## Code
```roc
file:main.roc
```

## Output

Run this from the directory that has `main.roc` in it:

```
$ roc run
List [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] has a length of 10
5 found at index 4 in the list [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

```

You can also use `roc test` to run the tests.
